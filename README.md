# Diligent Engine - A Modern Cross-Platform 3D Graphics Library

[Diligent Engine](http://diligentgraphics.com/diligent-engine/) is a light-weight cross-platform abstraction layer between the 
application and the platform-specific graphics API. 
Its main goal is to take advantages of the next-generation APIs such as Direct3D12 and Vulkan, but at the same time provide support 
for older platforms via Direct3D11, OpenGL and OpenGLES. Diligent Engine exposes common front-end for all supported platforms and 
provides [interoperability with underlying native API](http://diligentgraphics.com/diligent-engine/native-api-interoperability/).  
[Shader source code converter](http://diligentgraphics.com/diligent-engine/shader-converter/) allows shaders authored in HLSL to 
be translated to GLSL and used on all supported platforms. 
The engine supports [integration with Unity](http://diligentgraphics.com/diligent-engine/integration-with-unity/) and is designed to be 
used as a graphics subsystem in a standalone game engine, Unity native plugin or any other 3D application. It is distributed under 
[Apache 2.0 license](License.txt) and is free to use.

 git clone --recursive https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentEngine.git 
 
 Alternatively, you can get master repository fisrt, and then individually clone all submodules into the engine's root folder.
 
 To checkout the last stable release, run the following commands:
 
* git checkout tags/v2.2.a

* git submodule update --init --recursive


## Repository Structure

Master repository includes the following submodules:

* [Core](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentCore) submodule provides basic engine functionality. 
  It implements the engine API using 
  [Direct3D11](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentCore/tree/master/Graphics/GraphicsEngineD3D11), 
  [Direct3D12](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentCore/tree/master/Graphics/GraphicsEngineD3D12), and
  [OpenGL/GLES](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentCore/tree/master/Graphics/GraphicsEngineOpenGL). 
  It also implements 
  [HLSL to GLSL source code converter](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentCore/tree/master/Graphics/HLSL2GLSLConverterLib).
  The module is self-contained and can be built by its own.
* [Tools](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentTools) submodule contains 
  [texture loading library](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentTools/tree/master/TextureLoader) and 
  [Render Script](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentTools/tree/master/RenderScript), a Lua-based run-time 
  graphics resource managing system. Tools module depends on Core module.
* [Samples](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentSamples) submodule contains several simple graphics applications 
  intended to demonstrate the usage of the Diligent Engine API. The module depends on Core and Tools modules.
  

# Build and Run Instructions

Diligent Engine uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as a cross-platform build tool. 
To start using cmake, download the [latest release](https://cmake.org/download/) (3.10 or later is required).

## Win32

To generate build files for Windows desktop platform, use either CMake GUI or command line tool. For example, to generate 
[Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community) 64-bit solution and project files in *cmk_build/Win64* folder, 
navigate to the engine's root folder and run the following command:

*cmake -H. -B./cmk_build/Win64 -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"*

You can generate Win32 solution that targets Win8.1 SDK using the following command:

*cmake -D CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=8.1 -H. -B./cmk_build/Win64 -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"*

**WARNING!** In current implementation, full path to cmake build folder **must not contain white spaces**. (If anybody knows a way
to add quotes to CMake's custom commands, please let me know!)

Open DiligentEngine.sln file in cmk_build/Win64 folder, select configuration and build the engine. Set the desired project
as startup project (by default, Asteroids demo will be selected) and run it. 

By default, appplications will run in D3D11 mode. To select D3D12 or OpenGL, use the following command line options:
**mode=D3D11**, **mode=D3D12**, or **mode=GL** (do not use spaces!). If you want to run an application outside of Visual Studio environment,
the application's assets folder must be selected as a working directory. (For Visual Studio, this is automatically configured by 
CMake). 

## Universal Windows Platform

To generate build files for Universal Windows platform, you need to define the following two cmake variables:

* CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=WindowsStore 
* CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=< Windows SDK Version >

For example, to generate Visual Studio 2017 64-bit solution and project files in *cmk_build/UWP64* folder, run the following command
from the engine's root folder:

*cmake -D CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=WindowsStore -D CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=10.0 -H. -B./cmk_build/UWP64 -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"*

You can target specific SDK version by refining CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION, for instance:

*cmake -D CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=WindowsStore -D CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=10.0.15063.0 -H. -B./cmk_build/UWP64 -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"*

Set the desired project as startup project (by default, Atmosphere sample will be selected) and run it. 

Note: you can generate solution that targets Windows 8.1 by defining CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=8.1 cmake variable, but the solution will fail
to build as it will use Visual Studio 2013 (v120) toolset that lacks proper c++11 support.

## Linux

Your Linux environment needs to be set up for c++ development. To configure my fresh Ubuntu 17.10, I installed the following packages:

1. gcc, make and other essential c/c++ tools:

* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get upgrade
* sudo apt-get install build-essential

2. cmake

* sudo apt-get install cmake

3. Other required packages:

* sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
* sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev
* sudo apt-get install mesa-utils
* sudo apt-get install libgl-dev

To generate make files for debug configuration, run the following CMake command from the engine's root folder:

*cmake -H. -B./cmk_build/Linux64 -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug"* 

To build the engine, run the following command:

*cmake --build ./cmk_build/Linux64*

The engine's root folder contains [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) settings files that configure
the IDE to build the engine. You can run applications directly from the IDE. To run an application from the command line,
the app's assets folder must be current directory.

## Android

Please make sure that your machine is set up for Android development. Download 
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html), [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html) and
other required tools. To verify that your environment is properly set up, try building 
[teapots sample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-ndk/tree/master/teapots).

Open *DiligentSamples/Android* or *UnityPlugin/Android* folders with Android Studio to build and run
the engine samples and Unity emulator on Android.

## MacOS

After you clone the repo, run the following command from the engine's root folder to generate Xcode project
(you need to have [CMake](https://cmake.org/) installed on the system):

*cmake -H. -B./cmk_build/MacOS -G "Xcode"*

Open Xcode project file in cmk_build/MacOS folder to build the engine and run the applications. 

## iOS

Run the command below from the engine's root folder to generate Xcode project configured for iOS build
(you need to have [CMake](https://cmake.org/) installed on your Mac):

*cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=DiligentCore/ios.toolchain.cmake -H. -Bcmk_build/IOS -GXcode*

Open Xcode project file in cmk_build/IOS folder and build the engine. To run the applications on an iOS device,
you will need to set the appropriate development team in the project settings.

## Customizing Build

Diligent Engine allows clients to customize build settings by providing configuration script file that defines two optional functions:

* `custom_configure_build()` - defines global build properties such as build configurations, c/c++ compile flags, link flags etc.
* `custom_configure_target()` - defines custom settings for every target in the build.

The path to the configuration script should be provided through `BUILD_CONFIGURATION_FILE` variable when running 
cmake and must be relative to the cmake root folder, for example:

*cmake -D BUILD_CONFIGURATION_FILE=BuildConfig.cmake -H. -B./cmk_build/Win64 -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"*

### Customizing global build settings with custom_configure_build() function

If defined, `custom_configure_build()` function is called before any build target is added. By default,
cmake defines the following four configurations: Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, MinSizeRel. If you want, 
you can define your own build configurations by setting `CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES` variable. For instance,
if you want to have only two configuration: Debug and ReleaseMT, add the following line to the `custom_configure_build()`
function:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES Debug ReleaseMT CACHE STRING "Configuration types: Debug, ReleaseMT" FORCE)
```

The build system needs to know the list of debug and release (optimized) configurations, so the following
two variables must also be set when `CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES` variable is defined:

```cmake
set(DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS DEBUG CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
set(RELEASE_CONFIGURATIONS RELEASEMT CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
```

Note that due to cmake specifics, configuration names listed in `DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS` and `RELEASE_CONFIGURATIONS`
**must be capitalized**.

If you define any configuration other than four standard cmake ones, you also need to set the following variables, for every
new configuration:

* `CMAKE_C_FLAGS_<Config>` - c compile flags
* `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_<Config>` - c++ compile flags
* `CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_<Config>` - executable link flags
* `CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_<Config>` - shared library link flags

For instance:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASEMT "/MT" CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASEMT "/MT" CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASEMT "/OPT:REF" CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
set(CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASEMT "/OPT:REF" CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
```

Below is an example of custom_configure_build() function:

```cmake
function(custom_configure_build)
    if(CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES)
        # Debug configurations
        set(DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS DEBUG CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
        # Release (optimized) configurations
        set(RELEASE_CONFIGURATIONS RELEASEMT CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
        # CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES variable defines build configurations generated by cmake
        set(CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES Debug ReleaseMT CACHE STRING "Configuration types: Debug, ReleaseMT" FORCE)

        set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASEMT "/MT" CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
        set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASEMT "/MT" CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
        set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASEMT "/OPT:REF" CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
        set(CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASEMT "/OPT:REF" CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
    endif()
endfunction()
```


### Customizing individual target build settings with custom_configure_target() function

If defined, `custom_configure_target()` is called for every target created by the build system and
allows configuring target-specific properties.

By default, the build system sets some target properties. If `custom_configure_target()` sets all required properties,
it can tell the build system that no further processing is required by setting `TARGET_CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE` parent
scope variable to `TRUE`:

```cmake
set(TARGET_CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE TRUE PARENT_SCOPE)
```

The following is an example of `custom_configure_target()` function:

```cmake
function(custom_configure_target TARGET)
    set_target_properties(${TARGET} PROPERTIES
        STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS_RELEASEMT /LTCG
    )
    set(TARGET_CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE TRUE PARENT_SCOPE)   
endfunction()
```
